## Overarching Summer Goals
(admittedly a little ambitious, but that's me so)

- [ ] Be able to build up a full stack project as quickly as possible: Server, Database, Front End, Mobile, UI Design, etc.
- [ ] Create a concretely useful product/website/app that is publicly available to the world
- [ ] Understand my personal beliefs on education and how I might want to shape the rest of my life around 
- [ ] Build a useful platform for people with or without CS knowledge to learn how to be a software engineer by *doing*
- [ ] Spin up a personal website and actively blog my thoughts about the world in a coherent manner
- [ ] Reshape my lifestyle to be more healthy and active through food, exercise, and sleep
- [ ] Be a better friend to the people who I consider closest to me
